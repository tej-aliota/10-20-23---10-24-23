## A few Key Concepts:

A class is like a blueprint for creating an object.

To create an object using your class, you call a special method named the constructor. Instantiating an object of a class is a bit like saying, “Hey Python, you remember that blueprint I gave you? Well, I'd like you to use it to make an object.”

You need your object to have attributes; these are pieces of data stored inside the object. Assigning an object's attributes is a bit like taking several variables, each with its own name, and grouping them together with the object. Inside the constructor you define what attributes your object has and what their starting values will be. In your game so far, each room object has a name, a description, and a dictionary of the rooms linked to it.

The object must also have methods — ways for you to tell it what to do. Imagine writing methods as taking several functions, each with its own name, and making them available for use on the object. So inside the class, you define various methods for interacting with the object. In your example, you defined some getters and setters, and also methods to move between rooms and print out the details of each room.

Finally, each object you create is called an instance of its class, so each room object you made was an instance of Room.


## A few Key Words:


Constructor: a special method to tell Python how to create an object of this class: in Python, the constructor method is always called __init__ with a double underscore on each side of ‘init'

Dictionary: similar to a list, but allows you to give each element a name

Element: one item in a dictionary

Getter: a method whose purpose it is to get a value from within an object

Instantiate: create an object of a particular class

Parameter: a way of providing data so that it can be used within a method

Self: used within the code for an object to mean ‘this object'

Setter: a method whose purpose it is to set an attribute within an object
